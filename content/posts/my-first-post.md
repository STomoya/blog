# My First Post

This is my first post ever on my blog.  

## Motivation

I wanted a place that I can output things that I had learned.


## Static Site Generators

I have tried

- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

I ended up using Hugo.

The reason I didn't choose the other two was because it was alittle too complicated for my purpose.
I only wanted to make a really simple site that I can post articles really easy.
And also, in Hugo, it is very simple to handle with tags and categories.

In the other hand I felt that Gatsby is better when making websites that are bigger and more complicated.

## Theme

I used the [github-style](https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style/) for the theme in this site.
I editted some code so that articles can be retrieved by the tags and categories.
